"""
Email Summarization Agent - Current Client Focused AI Analysis Engine

A specialized, reusable AI agent that provides intelligent analysis and summarization of email
interactions for a specific current client using multiple LLM providers (Google Gemini and OpenAI).
This agent is designed to be used as a common component by other specialized agents that need
client-specific email analysis.

Key Features:
1. Current client focused email analysis from interaction_details field
2. Structured JSON output with Activities/Insights/Next Move format
3. Multi-provider AI support (Gemini, OpenAI)
4. Activity status based on interaction timestamps (<7 days = active, >7 days = inactive)
5. Three-sentence insights format for proper structure and readability
6. Recent email summary between current employee and current client

Core Analysis Capabilities:
- Current client email content summarization and key point extraction
- Communication pattern analysis for specific client relationships
- Sentiment and tone analysis of client-specific email exchanges
- Action item identification focused on current client needs
- Relationship health assessment for the current client
- Strategic communication insights for current client management

Required Output Format:
All analysis methods return structured JSON output including:
- CLIENT_ID: The current client being analyzed
- ACTIVITIES: List of current client email interactions with status (active/inactive/decline)
- INSIGHTS: Client-specific analysis insights with exactly 3 sentences each
- RECENT_EMAIL_SUMMARY: Most recent email between employee and current client
- NEXT_MOVE: Recommended actions based on current client email analysis

Supported Providers:
- Google Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro)
- OpenAI (gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo)
