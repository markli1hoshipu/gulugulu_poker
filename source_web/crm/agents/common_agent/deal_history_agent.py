"""
Deal History Agent - Reusable AI Analysis Engine with Structured Output

A flexible, reusable AI agent that provides intelligent analysis of deal histories using
multiple LLM providers (Google Gemini and OpenAI). This agent is designed to be used as
a common component by other specialized agents.

Key Features:
1. Variable input support - can analyze any number of deal records
2. Structured output format with required sections
3. Multi-provider AI support (Gemini, OpenAI)
4. Consistent formatting with total value, deal count, descriptions, and insights
5. Enhanced prompt engineering for better accuracy

Core Analysis Capabilities:
- Deal performance analysis with structured output
- Pattern recognition across multiple deals
- Trend identification with quantitative metrics
- Risk assessment with specific indicators
- Opportunity identification with actionable insights
- Strategic insights generation with required format

Required Output Format:
All analysis methods return structured output including:
- DEAL SUMMARY: Total Value, Number of Deals, Won Value
- DEAL DESCRIPTIONS: Each deal with name, value, stage, description
- INSIGHTS/ANALYSIS: Specific analysis based on method type

Supported Providers:
- Google Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro)
- OpenAI (gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo)
